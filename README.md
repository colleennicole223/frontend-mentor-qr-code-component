## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Overview

Focused on responsive design by using 'flex' properties - allowing the component to react to different screen sizes. 

### What I Learned

- Had to look up how to control the box shadow effects - which [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) was a helpful resource. 
- Images must have alternate text for screen readers
- Document should have one main landmark - easier to navigate to primary content
- Page should contain a level-one heading for screen readers
