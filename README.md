## My process

### Built with

- HTML & CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I focused on responsive design by using 'flex' properties, allowing the component to react to different screen sizes. 

The only thing I had to look up for this project was how to control the box shadow effects - which [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) was a helpful resource.
